DESCRIPTION = [
  "My hobbies are reading books and working out. Along with this, I also like cooking. While researching the company, I got to know about the in-house gym. Having a gym in the workplace is a great idea as employees can get to know each other better on a casual level apart from their designated roles.",
  "I usually spend my leisure time reading books or playing badminton. I like reading new and trending novels and my favourite genres include suspense, horror and thriller novels. Being a voracious reader, I believe that I have a strong vocabulary and knowledge of grammar. My zeal for writing gets its flair from my passion for reading books.",
  "I have a pet dog named Cookie and spending time with him is one of my favourite things to do. I also love to travel and I often plan trips with my family. But solo travelling gives me the bliss that I crave for. Every year I look forward to exploring new places and catching up on some lifetime memories.",
  "I like participating in volunteer activities especially teaching underprivileged kids. I have been associated with a few non-profit organisations since my college days and I like spending my weekends helping these NGOs for different activities from teaching to organising interesting games and activities to make learning fun for kids.",
  "I like learning new skills and recently I have been interested in exploring different languages as they help me explore new cultures around the world. I started learning Spanish online and I have already cleared the beginner level. I generally spend my weekends focusing on exploring new Spanish words and watching Spanish movies to strengthen my grasp over the language.",
  "I have played football since high school and I have also been the captain of my college team. I love playing football in my free time as it helps me unwind, relax as well as boosts my creativity and analytical thinking skills.",
  "My favourite hobby is travelling because I love discovering new cities and places around the world. I often save up for months to plan a trip every year. I love friendsâ€™ trips and family outings but solo travelling brings me the real adventure and thrill to venture into new places all by myself.",
  "I like spending time in nature and capture all the wonderful moments of beauty with my camera. I have been doing nature photography since I was in school and is the best hobby I think I am truly proud of.",
  "My best hobby is meditating and spending my free time at meditation retreats. I think it has really helped me understand my mind and its complexities and in ensuring a better mental wellbeing.",
  "Composing music and songwriting have been my favourite pastime since I was in high school. I have my own garage band with a few of my high school classmates and we spend our free weekends and holidays composing new tunes and performing at open clubs."
