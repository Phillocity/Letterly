  "Hi you!
  We don’t know each other, but I just want to encourage you today in this crazy time we are living!
  I came across this poem today, and I thought I’d share it with you today!
  ” When things start to feel
  Like things should have
  Been better this year,
  Remember the mountains and valleys
  That got you here.
  They are not accidents,
  And those moments weren’t in vain
  You are not the same.
  You have grown and you are growing
  You are breathing, you are living.
  You are wrapped in
  endless
  boundless
  grace.
  And things will get better.
  There is more to you than yesterday”
  – Morgan Harper Nichols

  I don’t know your situation right now, but just know you are not alone. There is someone thinking of you.",

  "Hey you!
  You don’t know me, and I don’t know you. But that is totally ok!
  My name is Charlotte, and most likely, I am not in the same position in life as you. But we have something in common: in this time we probably both miss our loved ones.
  My family is all overseas, in the Netherlands, and I was supposed to go visit them last week, after not seeing them for a year and a half. Naturally, I was super bummed to have to cancel my trip.
  Now, I could have wallowed in that loss, and let it affect me and my activities this week. But I am not a victim, and I don’t want to let my emotions dictate my actions.
  So I started looking at the positive things this situation has brought me – I am seeing my husband more, since his store is closed and he is at home. I talk to my mom more, just to catch up – as well as my sisters. Yesterday, I got to record a crafting video that will help bring some kids joy and a way to express themselves! I would for sure not have thought to do that if March had gone the way I planned it.
  All this to say – I hope you get to see some silver linings in this uncertain time. Any small shimmer can give us the hope to move forward!
  And if you can’t right now – that is ok. Nobody can blame you. I just hope this little note brings you a little joy – just know I am thinking of you!",

  "To Whoever Finds This,
  Isn’t it strange to read the words of a person you’ve never met? Or maybe we have met and don’t know it. Maybe we will meet. Maybe we’ll be friends, or lovers, or perhaps we’ll instantly dislike each other. Right now we’re just strangers, having a one-sided conversation on a piece of paper.

  If you’ll lend me a moment of your time, maybe it will be as though we have met. I’ll share a piece of me, and maybe it will touch a piece of you. If you look around the room you’re in, maybe every person in it has the ability to change you in some way. Maybe you have the ability to change someone else.

  I think we’ve all felt lonely sometimes. Even when you are surrounded by people, you can feel completely alone. In fact, that’s the hardest kind of loneliness there is - lying next to someone you love, or in the presence of friends. How do you solve that kind of disconnect, when the people you care about are within reach, but you cannot seem to touch them? Have you ever felt that way? Maybe you are blessed with connectedness and love, or maybe you struggle to find fleeting moments of it. Maybe you ride waves of joy before being swept under by a sea of sadness.

  Life is too short to feel alone. It’s scary, and hard, and vulnerable, and no one really talks about it. Sometimes I get scared. I’m scared there isn’t enough time to do the things that matter, or be with the people I love. I’m scared I’ll hurt people with my words and actions and not be able to make it right. I’m scared that doing my best won’t be enough. I’m scared we will go through life never really feeling whole.

  I don’t know what your life is like… but if you’ve felt lonely, or afraid, or disconnected from the world, then please hear me. You are not alone, and it’s okay to be scared, and if you are looking for connection, make it. Reach out to someone instead of waiting for them to reach out to you. Ask for what you need. Write a letter to someone you do not know. Maybe we are all just waiting for someone to share a piece of themselves.

  Thanks for letting me talk. I hope we meet someday.",

  "A Letter to a Stranger,
  We don’t know each other. I’m the true definition of a stranger. A person you’re not familiar with, but a person that has been praying for you nonetheless. Life’s path, and my introduction to grief, turned me into someone that feels deeper than most. Someone that empathizes with a greater force and a larger chunk of my heart. I’ve known loss, and it changed the composition of my heart.

  In many ways, grief made me a better person. It taught me to love deeper. To journey through life with a heart full of grace and a mind full of patience. It taught me to notice others. Truly notice them. To pray for them, listen to them, and help them feel less alone. It taught me to listen intently to the stories of others. Grief taught me the importance of a story, and the importance of feeling loved and understood.

  Today, I heard a piece of your story. I learned of the ache in your heart and the sorrow in your soul. I could feel the defeat. I could feel the dissipating hope. I could feel the sense of pain, anger, confusion, sadness, and ultimately, the anxiousness of the unknown. It was at that very moment, I stopped and I prayed for you. I prayed fiercely for you with heartfelt intentions. I hope that some of that comfort and love found you, even if it was from the heart of a stranger.

  I hope you can comprehend the strength and bravery that you possess. Even when you don’t feel it. Even when it’s buried so deep you think you’ll never find it again.

  You are strong. You are brave. You are capable of overcoming hard things, even if it feels like a task that will break your spirit into pieces. You can and will get through this, even if that means getting through it with pieces of your heart broken or lost.

  You are amazing and loved, even on your weakest and darkest days. You have a heart filled with love and dedication. You have a sparkle in your eye that radiates compassion and grace. You have a spirit that inspires others. You may not realize the lengths of your influence, but it is mighty. Your story and journey are important.

  On the days you feel lost, without hope, without support, and without the strength to continue, remember that you have strangers praying for you. You’ve got strangers lifting you up in comforting thoughts and encouraging wishes.

  You’ve got people out there kneeling in prayer and saying your name out loud.

  I pray you feel love.

  I pray you feel comfort.

  I pray you feel supported and noticed.

  I pray you become wrapped in strength and the courage to continue.

  I pray you feel immense hope and the possibility of miracles.

  You matter.

  You don’t realize your inspiration, because you live with it everyday, but it is visible to the rest of the world. It’s so noticable, it was even seen by a stranger. "
